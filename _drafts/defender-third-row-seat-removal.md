	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<strong>1. Wheel Arches</strong>
		<p>Under the rear wheel arch, undo the two nuts circled in red with a size 13 spanner. The bolts are held in place above. Remove and store the two nuts washers.</p>

	<div class="instruction">
		<strong>2. Attachment Covers</strong>
		<p>Inside the vehicle, remove the plastic covers over the seat bolts. The two closest to the door are held in place with unscrewable plastic fasteners (circled in yellow). On the other side of the seat they are held on by fixed plastic fasteners (circled in blue).</p>
		<p>The fixed fasteners need to be carefully pulled out as to avoid breaking them.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<strong>3. Seat Attachments</strong>
		<p>With the seat attachments exposed undo all of the bolts circled in blue and the seat belt fastener (circled in red).</p>
		<p>These are easier to undo with the seat in the stowed position as less weight is pulling them down.</p>

		<a href="/assets/defender-third-row/floor.jpg" target="_blank" title="Seat Attachments"><img title="Seat Attachments" alt="Seat to floor attachments" src="/assets/defender-third-row/floor.jpg"></a>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<strong>4. Bottom Attachments</strong>
		<p>Underneath the seats remove the eight bolts and washers securing the seat to the floor and wheel arch. These bolts can be seen, circled blue in the first two images (Wheel Arches).</p>
		<p>These are easier to undo with the seat in the down position (with the backrest collapsed).</p>

	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<strong>5. Finish</strong>
		<p>Now all the attachments are undone and the seats are free, carefully pull up and away from the side and the seats should come loose. They are not light, so carefully remove them from the vehicle.</p>
		<p>You will now find yourself with 44 extra holes in the vehicle, you could either reinsert the bolts or tap the holes with some rubber plugs.</p>
